## PVIM ESP32 AD7606 Precision Voltage IoT Monitor SDK Board

This PVIM Board is a Precision, Eight Channel, Synchronous Data Acquisition board with Simultaneously Sampled Isolated Inputs.

This project is planned to be updated and launched on **KickStarter in Q2 2025**.  Other information can be found on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/DitroniX/pvim-esp32-ad7606-precision-voltage-iot-monitor-sdk-board-acbe1f) 

Updates include:

* Increased speed of MCU, such as ESP32-S3 or better ESP32-P4. This will provide better computational speed where high speed data acquisitions are needed.

* Change the USB to the Type C and also update the UART due to obsolescence.

* Tinker with the PSU. Whilst it is OK I want to improve.

* Add Ethernet. This would help in many use cases.

The AD7606BBSTZ (16-bit ADC with 800 kSPS), or even an AD7606C-18BSTZ (18-bit ADC with 1 MSPS on all channels), is still in the shopping list.
